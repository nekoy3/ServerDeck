# Sensitive information (e.g., passwords in config files)
# IMPORTANT: servers.yaml contains sensitive data. Consider encrypting it or using environment variables.
# For now, we will NOT ignore config/servers.yaml as it's part of the project structure.
# If you decide to move sensitive data out of it, you might want to add it here.
